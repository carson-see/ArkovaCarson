# ARKOVA — Claude Code Engineering Directive

> **Version:** 2026-03-16 (Sprint 3 PRs merged — security hardening, testnet4, AI extraction — 15/19 AI stories, migration 0063)
> **Repo:** ArkovaCarson | **Branch:** main | **Deploy:** arkova-carson.vercel.app
> **Companion files:** `HANDOFF.md` (living state — Phase 3/4 tracking), `ARCHIVE_memory.md` (historical context)

Claude Code reads this file automatically before every task. It contains the rules, the repo map, and the current story status. If something conflicts with HANDOFF.md, this file wins on rules; HANDOFF.md wins on current state.

## 0. MANDATORY METHODOLOGY — APPLIES BEFORE ALL OTHER RULES

> **These five mandates override everything below. No exceptions. No shortcuts.**

### ARCHITECT MANDATE
You must use your `sequential-thinking` MCP tool to brainstorm and validate architecture before writing any code. Break complex problems into manageable steps. Do not jump to implementation — think first, plan the approach, identify risks, then execute.

### TDD MANDATE
All code must follow Test-Driven Development (Red-Green-Refactor):
1. **Red:** Write a failing test that defines the desired behavior.
2. **Green:** Write the minimum code to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor:** Clean up the code while keeping tests green.
No production code without a corresponding test written first.

### SECURITY MANDATE
You must manually check for PII leakage, command injection, and vulnerable dependencies before finalizing any file. Act as your own Code Reviewer. Specifically:
- Scan for hardcoded secrets, API keys, PII in logs or error messages.
- Check for command injection, SQL injection, XSS, and path traversal.
- Verify dependencies are not known-vulnerable (`npm audit`).
- Confirm RLS policies cover new tables/columns.
- This is in addition to (not a replacement for) Constitution Section 1.4.

### TOOLING MANDATE
Always use the Playwright MCP tool to verify frontend UI changes. After any component, page, or styling change:
- Navigate to the affected page.
- Take a snapshot or screenshot to confirm the change renders correctly.
- Verify no visual regressions on adjacent components.

### UAT MANDATE
Every prompt that involves UI/frontend work (component changes, page updates, styling, routing, layout) **must conclude with a UAT verification step** before finalizing. This means:
1. **Start the dev server** (via `preview_start` or equivalent).
2. **Navigate to every affected page** at both desktop (1280px) and mobile (375px) viewports.
3. **Take screenshots** or snapshots to confirm changes render correctly.
4. **Check for regressions** on adjacent pages that share modified components (e.g., if AppShell changes, verify Dashboard, Records, and Org pages).
5. **Log any new bugs found** during UAT in `docs/bugs/` with full reproduction steps.
6. If authentication is required and unavailable in the dev environment, verify structure via accessibility snapshots and document the limitation.

UAT is not optional. A task is not complete until UAT screenshots confirm the changes work at both viewport sizes.

### BACKLOG MANDATE
All backlog items — stories, bugs, security findings, operational tasks, GEO items — **must exist in a single source of truth**: `docs/BACKLOG.md`. This document is prioritized and re-prioritized each session. No backlog item should exist only in a story doc, bug report, or session log — it must also appear in BACKLOG.md. When work is completed, update BACKLOG.md before closing the session. Every backlog item must also have corresponding story documentation in `docs/stories/` (grouped by priority level).

---

## 0.1. READ FIRST — EVERY SESSION

```
1. CLAUDE.md          ← You are here. Rules, Mandates, Constitution, story status.
2. HANDOFF.md         ← Living state. Phase 3/4 tracking, blockers, decisions.
3. docs/BACKLOG.md    ← **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all open work (stories, bugs, security, ops).
4. ARCHIVE_memory.md  ← Historical context from prior phases.
5. docs/confluence/01_architecture_overview.md  ← If it exists.
6. The relevant agents.md in any folder you are about to edit.
7. The story card from the Technical Backlog for the story you are implementing.
```

If a folder contains an `agents.md`, read it before touching anything. If you learn something important during your work, update that folder's `agents.md` AND the "Current State" section of HANDOFF.md.

---

## 1. THE CONSTITUTION — RULES THAT CANNOT BE BROKEN

These rules apply to every task. If a story conflicts with any rule below, **the rule wins**.

### 1.1 Tech Stack (Locked)

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Lucide React | Vite bundler |
| Database | Supabase (Postgres + Auth) | RLS mandatory on all tables |
| Validation | Zod | All write paths validated before DB call |
| Routing | react-router-dom v6 | Named routes in `src/lib/routes.ts` |
| Worker | Node.js + Express in `services/worker/` | Webhooks, anchoring jobs, cron |
| Payments | Stripe (SDK + webhooks) | Worker-only, never browser |
| Chain | bitcoinjs-lib + AWS KMS (target) | SignetChainClient implemented; MockChainClient for tests. AWS KMS for mainnet TBD. |
| Testing | Vitest + Playwright + RLS test helpers | `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:rls`, `npm run test:e2e` |
| Ingress | Cloudflare Tunnel (`cloudflared`) | Zero Trust ingress to worker container. No public ports. |
| Edge Compute | Cloudflare Workers + `wrangler` (dev dep) | Peripheral tasks only (Queues, R2, AI fallback). NOT for core worker logic. |
| Observability | Sentry (`@sentry/react`, `@sentry/node`, `@sentry/profiling-node`) | Error tracking + performance. PII scrubbing mandatory. |
| AI (extended) | `@cloudflare/ai` (fallback), `replicate` (QA only), `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (future) | See scoping rules below. Primary AI remains Vertex AI ADK (P8). |

**Hard constraints:**
- Never use Next.js API routes for long-running jobs
- New AI libraries require explicit architecture review before introduction
- No server-side document processing — ever (see 1.6)
- Cloudflare Workers handle ONLY peripheral edge tasks (queues, reports, AI fallback). Core anchor processing, Stripe webhooks, and cron jobs stay in `services/worker/` Express container.
- `@cloudflare/ai` is fallback-only — never the primary extraction provider. Gated by `ENABLE_AI_FALLBACK` flag (default: `false`).
- `replicate` is QA/synthetic-data-only — hard-blocked in production (`NODE_ENV=production` + `ENABLE_SYNTHETIC_DATA!=true`).
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is installed for future use. No MCP server code until P4.5 Verification API is complete.
- Sentry must have PII scrubbing enabled. No user emails, document fingerprints, or API keys in Sentry events (Constitution 1.4 + 1.6).

### 1.2 Schema-First (Non-Negotiable)

- Define DB schema + enums + constraints + RLS **before** building any UI that depends on them
- Once a table exists, **never use mock data or useState arrays** to represent that table's data — query Supabase
- Every schema change requires: migration file + rollback comment + regenerated `database.types.ts` + updated seed data + updated Confluence page
- Never modify an existing migration file — write a new compensating migration

### 1.3 Terminology (UI Copy Only)

**Banned terms — never appear in any user-visible string:**

`Wallet` · `Gas` · `Hash` · `Block` · `Transaction` · `Crypto` · `Blockchain` · `Bitcoin` · `Testnet` · `Mainnet` · `UTXO` · `Broadcast`

| Banned | Use Instead |
|--------|-------------|
| Wallet | Fee Account / Billing Account |
| Transaction | Network Receipt / Anchor Receipt |
| Hash | Fingerprint |
| Block | (omit or "Network Record") |
| Testnet / Mainnet | Test Environment / Production Network |
| Broadcast | Publish Anchor |

All UI copy sourced from `src/lib/copy.ts`. CI fails if banned terms appear: `npm run lint:copy`.

Internal code/DB may use technical names (e.g., `file_fingerprint_sha256`, `chain_tx_id`).

### 1.4 Security (Mandatory)

- RLS on every table. `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` on all tables.
- No direct writes to privileged fields from client code.
- SECURITY DEFINER functions must include `SET search_path = public`.
- Never expose `supabase.auth.admin` or service role key to the browser.
- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or private keys anywhere.
- Treasury/signing keys: server-side only, loaded from env vars, never logged.
- Stripe webhook handlers must call `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent()` — no exceptions.
- API keys must be hashed with HMAC-SHA256 using `API_KEY_HMAC_SECRET`. Raw keys never persisted after creation.
- API key lifecycle events (create, revoke) must be logged to `audit_events`.
- Setting `anchor.status = 'SECURED'` is worker-only via service_role — never from client code.

### 1.5 Timestamps & Evidence

- All server-side timestamps: Postgres `timestamptz`, treated as UTC.
- Bitcoin timestamps displayed as **"Network Observed Time"** — never "Confirmed At" or "Finalized".
- Proof packages must state: what is measured, what is asserted, what is NOT asserted.
- Jurisdiction tags are informational metadata — Arkova does not verify jurisdiction correctness.

### 1.6 Client-Side Processing Boundary

- **Documents never leave the user's device.** This is the foundational privacy guarantee.
- File fingerprinting (`generateFingerprint`) runs in the browser only — never server-side.
- `generateFingerprint` must never be imported or called in `services/worker/`.
- The Gemini AI Integration Specification in Drive describes server-side document processing — it violates this rule and is NOT authoritative. Do not reference it.

#### Constitution 4A — AI Metadata Exception

The foundational guarantee (documents never leave the device) remains absolute for **document bytes and raw OCR text**. A narrow exception exists for **PII-stripped structured metadata**:

1. **Client-side OCR** (PDF.js + Tesseract.js in a Web Worker) extracts raw text from the document on the user's device.
2. **Client-side PII stripping** removes all personally identifiable information (SSN, student IDs, DOB, email addresses, phone numbers, names matched against recipient fields) before anything leaves the browser.
3. **PII-stripped structured metadata** (credential type, issuer, dates, field labels — never raw OCR text, never document bytes) plus the document fingerprint may be sent to the server.
4. **Server-side AI** (Gemini Flash or equivalent via `IAIProvider`) processes only the PII-stripped metadata. The server never receives, stores, or processes the original document, its raw OCR output, or any PII.

**What MUST stay client-only:**
- Document bytes (PDF, image, etc.)
- Raw OCR text output
- Any text containing PII (pre-stripping)
- File fingerprinting (`generateFingerprint`)

**What MAY flow to server (post-stripping only):**
- Credential type classification
- Issuer name, issue/expiry dates
- Field labels and anonymized structure
- Document fingerprint (SHA-256 hash)

This exception is gated behind the `ENABLE_AI_EXTRACTION` feature flag (default: `false`). PII stripping is mandatory and cannot be disabled — there is no "raw mode" bypass.

### 1.7 Testing

- RLS tests must use `src/tests/rls/helpers.ts` `withUser()` / `withAuth()` — no ad-hoc auth mocking.
- Tests must not call real Stripe or Bitcoin APIs — use `IPaymentProvider` and `IAnchorPublisher` interfaces.
- Every task must keep the repo green: `typecheck`, `lint`, `test`, `lint:copy` all pass.
- Coverage enforced via `@vitest/coverage-v8`. Per-file 80% thresholds on critical paths (see `vitest.config.ts` and `services/worker/vitest.config.ts`). CI runs `npm run test:coverage`.

### E2E Testing Rules
_Added 2026-03-10 10:45 PM EST_

- E2E tests live in `e2e/` and use Playwright (`@playwright/test`).
- All E2E specs must use shared fixtures from `e2e/fixtures/` — no inline login flows.
- E2E test data: use seed users for reads, timestamped unique names for writes, cleanup after.
- Never hardcode Supabase URLs or keys in spec files — use env vars via fixtures.
- E2E tests must not depend on other spec files' side effects — each spec is isolated.
- New user-facing flows require a corresponding E2E spec before the story is marked COMPLETE.
- Run `npm run test:e2e` locally before pushing changes that affect routing, auth, or core flows.
- Load/stress tests live in `tests/load/` and run via `npm run test:load` — not part of CI gate.
- E2E fixtures: `e2e/fixtures/auth.ts` (authenticated pages), `e2e/fixtures/supabase.ts` (service client + seed users + test data helpers), `e2e/fixtures/index.ts` (barrel export).
- Seed user constants (`SEED_USERS`) are defined in `e2e/fixtures/supabase.ts` — never duplicate credentials inline.

### 1.8 API Versioning (Phase 1.5+)

- Verification API response schema is frozen once published. No field removals, type changes, or semantic changes without a new version prefix.
- Breaking changes require: v2+ URL prefix, 12-month deprecation notice, documented migration guide.
- Additive changes (new nullable fields) allowed without versioning.
- Frozen schema defined as `VerificationResult` OpenAPI component — single source of truth.

### 1.9 Feature Flags

- `ENABLE_VERIFICATION_API` controls all `/api/v1/*` endpoints. When `false`, returns HTTP 503.
- `ENABLE_PROD_NETWORK_ANCHORING` gates real Bitcoin chain calls. Both checked via `switchboard_flags` table.
- `/api/health` always available regardless of flag state.

### 1.10 Rate Limiting (Phase 1.5+)

- Anonymous: 100 req/min per IP.
- API key holders: 1,000 req/min per key.
- Batch endpoints: 10 req/min per API key.
- Rate limit headers on every response. HTTP 429 with `Retry-After` on excess.

## 2. HOW TO RECEIVE A TASK

**Format A — Story ID:**
> "Implement P7-TS-05"

1. Read the story card in the Technical Backlog (acceptance criteria, dependencies, tech notes, DoD)
2. Check the Audit Note — it tells you what exists and what the gap is
3. **Check CLAUDE.md Section 8** — story status may be more current than the backlog PDF
4. Verify all dependencies are met
5. **State your plan** before writing code: what you will change, what you will NOT touch, what tests you will run

**Format B — Direct instruction:**
> "Fix SecureDocumentDialog to use real Supabase insert"

1. Map to the closest story ID in Section 8
2. Proceed as Format A

**Format C — Brand/UI task:**
> "Apply Arkova brand tokens"

See Section 5.

---

## 3. TASK EXECUTION RULES

### Before writing code
- [ ] Read the story card fully
- [ ] Read the story doc in `docs/stories/` for your story's priority group
- [ ] Confirm dependencies are met (check Section 8)
- [ ] Read `agents.md` in any folder you will touch
- [ ] State your plan (files to change, files to leave alone, tests to run)

### While writing code
- [ ] One story at a time — do not fix unrelated things
- [ ] If you find a bug outside scope, log it in MEMORY.md Bug Tracker (full template) and stop
- [ ] New tables: migration + rollback comment + RLS + `database.types.ts` + seed update
- [ ] New hooks: follow `useAuth.ts` / `useAnchors.ts` pattern
- [ ] New components: `src/components/<domain>/` with barrel export in `index.ts`
- [ ] Validators: `src/lib/validators.ts` — not inline
- [ ] UI strings: `src/lib/copy.ts` — not hardcoded in JSX

### After writing code
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit          # zero type errors
npm run lint              # zero lint errors
npm run test:coverage     # all tests pass + coverage thresholds met
npm run lint:copy         # no banned terms
npm run gen:types         # if schema changed
```

Update `docs/confluence/` page if schema/security/API changed. Update the story doc in `docs/stories/` if story status changed (e.g., PARTIAL → COMPLETE). Update `agents.md` in modified folders. Update MEMORY.md "Session Handoff Notes" section.

- [ ] If you changed a user-facing flow: E2E spec exists and passes (`npm run test:e2e`)
- [ ] **UAT verification complete** (per UAT Mandate): Playwright screenshots at desktop + mobile confirm changes render correctly. Any new bugs logged in `docs/bugs/`.

### Bug Documentation (Mandatory)

Every bug found during development must be documented. Where it goes depends on severity:

- **Production blockers** → CLAUDE.md Section 8 Critical Blockers table (CRIT-N format)
- **All other bugs** → MEMORY.md Bug Tracker section

**Required fields for every bug (no exceptions):**
1. **Steps to reproduce** — numbered, specific, reproducible by someone unfamiliar with the code
2. **Expected vs actual behavior** — what should happen and what does happen
3. **Root cause** — if known at time of logging, update later when diagnosed
4. **Actions taken** — every action attempted to fix, with dates
5. **Resolution** — fix description + commit reference, or "OPEN"
6. **Regression test** — test file/name that prevents recurrence, or "None yet"

If a bug is found and fixed in the same session, still log it — the documentation prevents future regressions and builds institutional knowledge.

### Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria met
- Unit tests written and passing
- `typecheck` + `lint` + `test` + `lint:copy` all green
- Seed data click-through still works
- Confluence docs updated if applicable
- No regressions
- **UAT verified** — Playwright screenshots at desktop (1280px) and mobile (375px) confirm UI changes render correctly

## 5. BRAND APPLICATION — "Nordic Vault" Design System (PR #42)

### Brand Colors

| Name | Hex | HSL | Usage |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| Steel Blue | `#82b8d0` | 197 42% 66% | Primary / buttons / links |
| Charcoal | `#303433` | 156 4% 19% | Sidebar background / foreground |
| Ice Blue | `#dbeaf1` | 199 44% 90% | Secondary / light backgrounds |

### Typography (Locked)

| Token | Family | Source | Usage |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| `font-sans` | **DM Sans** (300–700) | Google Fonts, `index.html` | Headings, body text, UI labels |
| `font-mono` | **JetBrains Mono** (400, 500) | Google Fonts, `index.html` | Fingerprints, IDs, code blocks |

**Banned fonts:** Inter, Roboto, Arial, Space Grotesk, system-ui default stack. Never revert to these.

### CSS Custom Properties

The `:root` and `.dark` blocks in `src/index.css` define all theme tokens. The Arkova palette is already applied (Steel Blue as primary, Charcoal as sidebar). See `tailwind.config.ts` for the `arkova.*` color scale. Extended vars: `--glow-primary`, `--glow-success`, `--surface-elevated`.

### Atmospheric CSS Classes (defined in `src/index.css`)

| Class | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `.bg-mesh-gradient` | Layered radial gradients for atmospheric content backgrounds |
| `.bg-dot-pattern` | Subtle dot grid pattern overlay (24px spacing) |
| `.glass-card` | Frosted glass (backdrop-filter blur 16px + transparency) |
| `.glass-header` | Glassmorphism header (blur 12px + saturate 1.5) |
| `.gradient-border` | Gradient border via CSS mask technique |
| `.glow-primary` / `.glow-success` | Colored glow box-shadows |
| `.nav-glow` | Active sidebar nav item glow bar (3px left) |
| `.sidebar-gradient` | Dark gradient for sidebar background |
| `.shimmer` | Animated loading state shimmer gradient |
| `.animate-in-view` | Staggered reveal-up animation (0.5s cubic-bezier) |
| `.animate-float` / `.animate-float-delayed` / `.animate-float-slow` | Floating decoration keyframes (6–8s) |
| `.stagger-1` through `.stagger-8` | Animation-delay utilities (60ms intervals) |

### Tailwind Shadows (defined in `tailwind.config.ts`)

| Token | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `shadow-glow-sm/md/lg` | Primary-colored glow shadows (increasing intensity) |
| `shadow-card-hover` | Elevated hover state for cards |
| `shadow-card-rest` | Subtle rest state for cards |

### Brand Rules for New Components

When creating ANY new frontend component, follow these rules:

1. **Cards:** Use `shadow-card-rest` at rest, `shadow-card-hover` on hover with `hover:-translate-y-0.5`
2. **Page entry:** Use `animate-in-view` with `stagger-N` for staggered reveal animations
3. **Loading:** Use `shimmer` class for loading skeletons (NOT `Skeleton` component)
4. **Icon containers:** `rounded-xl` with gradient backgrounds (`bg-gradient-to-br from-primary/15 to-primary/5`)
5. **Labels:** Uppercase with tracking: `text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-wide`
6. **Emphasis buttons:** `shadow-glow-sm hover:shadow-glow-md`
7. **Code/IDs:** `font-mono` (JetBrains Mono) for fingerprints, IDs, code
8. **Never revert** to Inter, Roboto, or system fonts
9. **Sidebar:** `sidebar-gradient` class, `nav-glow` on active items
10. **Header:** `glass-header` (backdrop blur), slim `h-14`
11. **Auth pages:** `bg-mesh-gradient` + `bg-dot-pattern` overlay + floating orbs + `gradient-border` card
12. **Status badges:** SECURED=green, PENDING=amber, REVOKED=gray, EXPIRED=gray
13. **Fingerprint display:** `font-mono text-xs bg-muted rounded px-2 py-1`
14. **Logo:** White wordmark + light blue bear on dark backgrounds; full-color on white

### Frontend Aesthetics Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts, Space Grotesk)
- Cliché color schemes (purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and cookie-cutter component patterns
- Flat solid-color backgrounds (use mesh gradients, dot patterns, atmospheric depth)
- Generic loading states (use shimmer, not basic skeleton rectangles)
- Missing motion (every page should have orchestrated entry animations)

## 6. DOCUMENTATION UPDATE PROCEDURE

Any task that changes schema, security posture, or API contracts must update docs in the same commit.

| What Changed | Update This Page |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Schema change | `docs/confluence/02_data_model.md` |
| RLS policy | `docs/confluence/03_security_rls.md` |
| Audit events | `docs/confluence/04_audit_events.md` |
| Legal hold / retention | `docs/confluence/05_retention_legal_hold.md` |
| Bitcoin / chain | `docs/confluence/06_on_chain_policy.md` |
| Seed data | `docs/confluence/07_seed_clickthrough.md` |
| Billing (P7+) | `docs/confluence/08_payments_entitlements.md` |
| Webhooks (P7+) | `docs/confluence/09_webhooks.md` |
| Worker (P7+) | `docs/confluence/10_anchoring_worker.md` |
| Proof packages (P7+) | `docs/confluence/11_proof_packages.md` |
| Verification API (P4.5+) | `docs/confluence/12_verification_api.md` |
| Identity / access | `docs/confluence/12_identity_access.md` |
| Feature flags | `docs/confluence/13_switchboard.md` |
| Story status change | `docs/stories/` (the group doc for that story's priority) |

If a page doesn't exist yet, create it using this template:

```markdown
# [Page Title]
_Last updated: [date] | Story: [story ID]_

## Overview
[1-2 sentence summary]

## Current State
[What is implemented]

## Schema / Contract
[Tables, columns, functions, or API contracts]

## Security Notes
[RLS, SECURITY DEFINER, access control]

## Change Log
| Date | Story | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
```

### Document Standards

All docs live in `docs/confluence/` and are numbered 00–15 (18 files total). The index (`00_index.md`) lists all documents with descriptions and a suggested reading order.

Every doc must include:
- `_Last updated: [date] | Story: [story ID]_` line below the title
- Schema docs reference specific migration numbers (e.g., "migration 0016")
- Implementation status tables distinguish **Complete / Partial / Not Started**
- Change log at the bottom tracking audit history
- Cross-references use relative markdown links (e.g., `[02_data_model.md](./02_data_model.md)`)

When a doc describes something that is partially implemented or a known gap exists, document it explicitly — never imply that something works if it doesn't.

### Story Documentation (`docs/stories/`)

Story docs live in `docs/stories/` and are grouped by priority level (one file per group). The index (`00_stories_index.md`) lists all 163 stories with status, group doc reference, and bug cross-references.

| File | Group | Stories |
|------|-------|---------|
| `01_p1_bedrock.md` | P1 Bedrock | 6 |
| `02_p2_identity.md` | P2 Identity & Access | 5 |
| `03_p3_vault.md` | P3 Vault & Dashboard | 3 |
| `04_p4e1_anchor_engine.md` | P4-E1 Anchor Engine | 3 |
| `05_p4e2_credential_metadata.md` | P4-E2 Credential Metadata | 3 |
| `06_p5_org_admin.md` | P5 Org Admin | 6 |
| `07_p6_verification.md` | P6 Verification | 6 |
| `08_p7_go_live.md` | P7 Go-Live | 13 |
| `09_p45_verification_api.md` | P4.5 Verification API | 13 |
| `10_deferred_hardening.md` | DH Deferred Hardening | 12 |
| `11_mvp_launch_gaps.md` | MVP Launch Gaps | 27 |
| `12_p8_ai_intelligence.md` | P8 AI Intelligence | 19 |
| `13_infrastructure_edge.md` | INFRA Edge & Ingress | 8 |
| `14_uat_sprints.md` | UAT Bug Fix Sprints (5+6) | 17 |
| `14_user_flow_gaps.md` | UF User Flow Gaps | 10 |
| `15_geo_seo.md` | GEO & SEO Optimization | 12 |

When a story's status changes:
1. Update the story's section in its group doc (Status field, Completion Gaps, Remaining Work)
2. Update the group overview counts at the top of the group doc
3. Update `00_stories_index.md` Completion Summary table
4. Update CLAUDE.md Section 8 story status table

PARTIAL stories must include "Completion Gaps" and "Remaining Work" subsections. When a PARTIAL story becomes COMPLETE, remove those subsections and update all status fields.

### agents.md Updates

After modifying any folder, update or create `agents.md`:

```markdown
# agents.md — [folder name]
_Last updated: [date]_

## What This Folder Contains
## Recent Changes
## Do / Don't Rules
## Dependencies
```

---

## 7. MIGRATION PROCEDURE

```bash
# 1. Create migration (next sequential number)
#    supabase/migrations/NNNN_descriptive_name.sql
#    Include at bottom: -- ROLLBACK: [compensating SQL]

# 2. Apply locally
npx supabase db push

# 3. Regenerate types
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/types/database.types.ts

# 4. Update seed data
#    Edit supabase/seed.sql

# 5. Verify click-through
npx supabase db reset

# 6. Update docs/confluence/02_data_model.md
```

**Never modify an existing migration file.** Write a new compensating migration instead.

**Current migration inventory:** 63 files, versions 0001–0065 (0033 skipped). Last: `0065_account_deletion.sql`. Migrations 0001–0058 applied to production. Migrations 0059–0065 pending production apply.

- P6-TS-02: ✅ QRCodeSVG in AssetDetailView for SECURED anchors. Links to `/verify/{publicId}`.
- P6-TS-03: ✅ COMPLETE — `VerificationWidget.tsx` routed at `/embed/verify/:publicId` via `EmbedVerifyPage`. Barrel export in `src/components/embed/index.ts`. Logs verification events with `method='embed'`. 10 tests (PR #57).
- P6-TS-04: ✅ COMPLETE — `AnchorLifecycleTimeline` wired into PublicVerification.tsx Section 5. `mapToLifecycleData()` maps snake_case RPC fields to camelCase props. Shows on both detail and public pages.
- P6-TS-05: ✅ `generateAuditReport.ts` (jsPDF, 201 lines). Called from RecordDetailPage.
- P6-TS-06: ✅ `verification_events` table (migration 0042), SECURITY DEFINER RPC (migration 0045), wired into PublicVerification.tsx.

### P7 Go-Live — 11/13 COMPLETE, 2/13 NOT STARTED

- P7-TS-05: ✅ COMPLETE (OPS-ONLY items remain) — `BitcoinChainClient` with provider abstractions: `SigningProvider` (WIF + KMS), `FeeEstimator` (static + mempool), `UtxoProvider` (RPC + Mempool.space). Async factory. `SupabaseChainIndexLookup` for O(1) verification. Migration 0050. 604 worker tests. Signet E2E broadcast verified (TX `b8e381df`). **Remaining operational only:** AWS KMS key provisioning, mainnet treasury funding. See `docs/confluence/15_operational_runbook.md`.
- P7-TS-07: ✅ COMPLETE — PDF + JSON proof package downloads both wired. Fixed in CRIT-5 (commit a38b485).
- P7-TS-08: ✅ `generateAuditReport.ts` — full PDF certificate with jsPDF.
- P7-TS-09: ✅ COMPLETE — WebhookSettings.tsx with two-phase dialog (creation form → one-time secret display). Server-side secret generation via SECURITY DEFINER RPC (migration 0046). 34 tests (23 component + 11 integration).
- P7-TS-10: ✅ COMPLETE — Delivery engine with exponential backoff + HMAC signing. `anchor.ts` dispatches `anchor.secured` webhook after SECURED status set. Webhook retries scheduled in worker cron.
- P7-TS-11: ✅ COMPLETE — Signet treasury wallet utilities (`wallet.ts`: `generateSignetKeypair()`, `addressFromWif()`, `isValidSignetWif()`). CLI scripts (`generate-signet-keypair.ts`, `check-signet-balance.ts`). 13 tests.
- P7-TS-12: ✅ COMPLETE — UTXO provider pattern (`utxo-provider.ts`): `UtxoProvider` interface with `RpcUtxoProvider` (Bitcoin Core JSON-RPC) and `MempoolUtxoProvider` (Mempool.space REST API). Factory function `createUtxoProvider()`. Integrated into `BitcoinChainClient` + `initChainClient()`. 35 tests.
- P7-TS-13: ✅ COMPLETE — `SupabaseChainIndexLookup` for O(1) fingerprint verification. Migration 0050 creates `anchor_chain_index` table. Chain index upsert in `processAnchor()` (non-fatal). Implemented as part of CRIT-2 Steps 5-8.

### P4.5 Verification API — 13/13 COMPLETE

## 10. PHASE 1.5 REFERENCE (Verification API — POST-LAUNCH)

Build order (dependency-ordered):

| # | Story | Task | Dep |
|---|-------|------|-----|
| 1 | P4.5-TS-12 | Feature flag middleware | None |
| 2 | P4.5-TS-03 | API keys table + HMAC + rate limiting | P1-TS-03 |
| 3 | P4.5-TS-01 | GET `/api/v1/verify/:publicId` | P6-TS-01 |
| 4 | P4.5-TS-06 | GET `/api/v1/jobs/:jobId` | P4.5-TS-03 |
| 5 | P4.5-TS-02 | POST `/api/v1/verify/batch` | P4.5-TS-01 |
| 6 | P4.5-TS-07 | Key CRUD endpoints | P4.5-TS-03 |
| 7 | P4.5-TS-05 | Free tier enforcement (10K/month) | P4.5-TS-03 |
| 8 | P4.5-TS-08 | GET `/api/v1/usage` | P4.5-TS-05 |
| 9 | P4.5-TS-04 | OpenAPI docs (`/api/docs`) | All above |
| 10 | P4.5-TS-09 | API Key Management UI | P4.5-TS-07 |
| 11 | P4.5-TS-10 | API Usage Dashboard Widget | P4.5-TS-05 |
| 12 | P4.5-TS-11 | API Key Scope Display | P4.5-TS-09 |
| 13 | P4.5-TS-13 | Rate limit load tests | All deployed |

**Frozen response schema:**

```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "status": "ACTIVE | REVOKED | SUPERSEDED | EXPIRED",
  "issuer_name": "string",
  "recipient_identifier": "string (hashed, never raw PII)",
  "credential_type": "string",
  "issued_date": "string | null",
  "expiry_date": "string | null",
  "anchor_timestamp": "string",
  "bitcoin_block": "number | null",
  "network_receipt_id": "string | null",
  "merkle_proof_hash": "string | null",
  "record_uri": "https://app.arkova.io/verify/{public_id}",
  "jurisdiction": "string (omitted when null, not returned as null)"
}
```

**Architecture Decision (ADR-001):** `record_uri` uses HTTPS (`https://app.arkova.io/verify/{public_id}`). No custom protocol handlers.

**File placement:**
- API routes: `services/worker/src/api/`
- Middleware: `services/worker/src/middleware/`
- Zod schemas: `services/worker/src/schemas/`
- API key UI: `src/components/api/ApiKeySettings.tsx` + `src/pages/ApiKeySettingsPage.tsx`
- Load tests: `tests/load/`

---

## 11. TESTING REFERENCE

### RLS Tests
```typescript
import { withUser, withAuth } from '../tests/rls/helpers';

it('blocks cross-tenant access', async () => {
  await withUser(userFromOrgA, async (client) => {
    const { data } = await client.from('anchors').select();
    expect(data).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

### Worker Tests
```typescript
const mockPayment: IPaymentProvider = { createCheckout: vi.fn() };
const mockChain: IAnchorPublisher = {
  publishAnchor: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ txId: 'mock_tx' })
};
```

### Gherkin → Test Mapping
- `Given` → test setup / `beforeEach`
- `When` → the action
- `Then` / `And` → `expect()` assertions

### Demo Users (Seed Data)

| Email | Password | Role | Org |
|-------|----------|------|-----|
| admin_demo@arkova.local | demo_password_123 | ORG_ADMIN | Arkova |
| user_demo@arkova.local | demo_password_123 | INDIVIDUAL | None |
| beta_admin@betacorp.local | demo_password_123 | ORG_ADMIN | Beta Corp |

## 12. COMMON MISTAKES — DO NOT DO THESE

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Do This Instead |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| `useState` for records from a Supabase table | Violates schema-first; stale data | Create a `useXxx()` hook querying Supabase |
| `supabase.insert()` without `validateAnchorCreate()` | Skips validation, allows forbidden fields | Always call Zod validator first |
| SECURITY DEFINER without `SET search_path = public` | Search path injection vulnerability | Always add it |
| User-visible text directly in JSX | No copy lint coverage, terminology drift | Add to `src/lib/copy.ts` first |
| Schema change without `gen:types` | TypeScript types out of sync | `supabase gen types typescript --local` |
| Real Stripe/Bitcoin calls in tests | CI breaks, flaky | Use mock interfaces |
| Setting `anchor.status = 'SECURED'` from client | Only worker via service_role | Let worker set SECURED |
| Exposing `user_id`, `org_id`, `anchors.id` on public page | Privacy violation | Only `public_id` + derived fields |
| `href="#"` for navigation | Dead link | `<Link to="/path">` from react-router-dom |
| Raw secrets in code | Security critical | Environment variables only |
| `jurisdiction: null` in API response | Frozen schema: omit when null | Conditional spread: `...(jurisdiction && { jurisdiction })` |
| Raw API key in DB | Security violation | HMAC-SHA256 hash with `API_KEY_HMAC_SECRET` |
| `generateFingerprint` in worker | Constitution violation | Fingerprinting is client-side only |
| `arkova://rec/` URI format | ADR-001: use HTTPS | `https://app.arkova.io/verify/{public_id}` |
| Following old `SecureDocumentDialog` pattern (pre-CRIT-1 fix) | Old version used setTimeout simulation | Follow `IssueCredentialForm` pattern — both now use real Supabase inserts |
