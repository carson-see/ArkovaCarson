## 2026-07-15 — SCRUM-2692 durable txid journal / HELD protection

`bitcoinAnchor.machine.ts` adds the three-valued conceptual `journalRecovery` state (`NONE | PENDING | HELD`) and explicit persist, HOLD, exact-tx ADOPT, affirmative-absence REVERT, and post-submit PERSISTED actions. Generic broadcast failure, legacy broadcast, submitted-abandon, and revoke edges cannot consume an unresolved journal; intent implies journal protection. PR-tier TLC passes 14 invariants with 3,589 generated / 529 distinct states and no deadlock or error.

## 2026-07-06 — S3-P0 persisted pre-broadcast intent (batch producer)

`bitcoinAnchor.machine.ts` now models the batch producer's no-double-broadcast crash-resume contract:

- New per-anchor bool **`intentPersisted`** (conceptual/derived, like `actor`): TRUE while a signed broadcast intent is durable (DB shape: `anchors.chain_tx_id` set while `status=BROADCASTING` + the `anchor_proofs` intent row carrying the signed tx hex).
- New actions: **`persistBroadcastIntent`** (BROADCASTING, chainTxId null → has_tx + intent), **`broadcastResumeFinalize`** (BROADCASTING+intent → SUBMITTED; models BOTH the happy path and the crash-resume reconcile — identical `submit_batch_anchors` write), **`broadcastIntentReject`** (definitive non-retryable mempool reject → PENDING, chainTxId cleared, intent cleared).
- **`broadcastFail`** and **`workerBroadcast`** gained `not(intentPersisted)` guards — `broadcastFail` now exactly models `recover_stuck_broadcasts()`'s `chain_tx_id IS NULL` filter (intent rows are shielded from the RACE-1 sweep); the legacy direct-broadcast edge applies only to non-intent flows. `supersede` clears the intent (row leaves BROADCASTING; submit/reconcile both skip it).
- **INV-1c REPLACED**: `broadcastingNoChainTx` ("BROADCASTING ⇒ chainTxId null") → **`broadcastingIntentChainTxCoupling`** ("BROADCASTING ⇒ chainTxId=has_tx ⟺ intentPersisted"). New invariants `intentOnlyWhileBroadcasting` + `intentRequiresWorkerActor`.
- Budgets raised (6th per-anchor bool): pr 200k → 1M raw estimate, nightly 50M → 500M. `check` (pr tier): proofPassed=true, 11 invariants, deadlockChecked, 757 states generated / 196 distinct, "No error has been found."

## Files
- **`bitcoinAnchor.machine.ts`** — formal model of the anchor lifecycle (PENDING -> SUBMITTED -> SECURED, plus REVOKED/EXPIRED/legal-hold transitions). Verified with `tla-precheck`. Any anchor lifecycle change must update this machine first and run `check`.
- **`calibrationWorkflow.machine.ts`** — formal model of confidence calibration workflow (IDLE -> EVALUATING -> DERIVING -> VALIDATING -> COMPLETE).
- **`tsconfig.json`** — TypeScript config for the machines package.

## Conventions
- Edit the machine BEFORE changing production anchor lifecycle code.
- Run `check` after every machine edit to verify invariants hold.
- Uses `tla-precheck` DSL (`defineMachine`, `enumType`, `variable`, `forall`, etc.).
