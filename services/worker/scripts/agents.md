# services/worker/scripts

Offline tooling for Nessie model training, evaluation, dataset building, benchmarks, operational helpers, and CI scripts. These scripts run outside the worker runtime — they are never imported by `services/worker/src/`.

## Soak drivers

- `pr2525-attestation-park-driver.ts` (+ `.test.ts`) — admission driver for the PR #2525 attestation
  park. Probes `GET /api/v1/verify/attestation/:id` and asserts the one behavior that PR changes:
  404 well-formed / 400 malformed with the `ARK-ATT` routing hint, never an APPLICATION 5xx, and
  `X-RateLimit-*` still present (the header is how the soak observes the middleware POSITION — a park
  mounted above the rate limiters answers correctly while silently off its §1.10 budget). `--live`
  needs `--target-url`; default `--dry-run`-equivalent is `self-test`, whose rows are
  `evidenceForSoak: false` and must never be cited as soak evidence.
  - **Capacity is not behavior.** Cloud Run refuses requests on a scaled-to-zero rig with a 500 and
    "no available instance"; a transport failure yields status 0. `isObserved()` excludes both, so
    neither is scored as an application regression — and a cycle where nothing was observed fails
    loudly rather than recording a hollow pass. That conflation invalidated the first soak window.

## Key subdirectories

- `bench/` — Regional latency benchmarks (Kenya, etc.).
- `benchmark/` — LLM-as-judge benchmark runner (NVI-12).
- `ci/` — CI helper scripts (Confluence DoD checker).
- `common/` — Shared API clients (Anthropic, Together) and concurrency helpers.
- `distillation/` — NVI-07 Opus teacher distillation pipeline.
- `intelligence-dataset/` — Compliance scenario datasets, evals, and source registries (FCRA/FERPA/HIPAA/KAU/NDD/NPH/NTF).
- `lib/` — Shared math utilities (percentile, stats).
- `load-test/` — k6 load-test profiles for SCALE-02.
- `ops/` — Operator-run production/sandbox verification scripts.

## Top-level scripts (selected)

- `nessie-*.ts` — Nessie model training, export, DPO, distillation, and LoRA pipeline drivers.
- `eval-*.ts` — Model evaluation harnesses (intelligence, fraud, latency, embedding).
- `build-*-dataset.ts` — Dataset builders for domain and FCRA intelligence corpora.
- `smoke-test*.ts` — Smoke tests for model endpoints.
- `derive-*.ts` — Calibration-knot and per-type calibration derivation scripts.
- `audit-secured-chain-integrity.ts` (SCRUM-2486 AC-2) — **STRICTLY READ-ONLY** operator CLI that audits the SECURED anchor back-catalogue (~2.97M rows) for the chain-integrity invariant (every `status='SECURED'` row must have a non-blank `chain_tx_id`, a 64-hex `fingerprint`, and — where populated — a positive `chain_block_height`). Resolves explicit staging/admission credentials first (`STAGING_SUPABASE_URL` + `STAGING_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, then `SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) and falls back to the prod service-role client from Secret Manager (same pattern as `check-anchor-status.ts`). Prints the structured JSON summary. **NO write path** — reports violations + bounded sample ids, never mutates/backfills/fabricates. All logic lives in the injectable `src/jobs/auditSecuredChainIntegrity.ts` library (unit-tested with a fake client that THROWS on any write). NOTE: apply/soak + any prod run is DEFERRED to Sprint-4 — authored + unit-tested here, not run against prod by the authoring session.

## Constraints

- Never import these scripts from the worker runtime (`services/worker/src/`).
- Tests must mock LLM and Stripe calls — no real API calls in test runs.
- Budget guardrails (`--limit N`, `--dry-run`) are mandatory on scripts that spend provider budget.
