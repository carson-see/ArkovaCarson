# Active Migration Notes

This directory now starts with the Path C baseline, `00000000000000_baseline_at_main_HEAD.sql`.

- Do not split the baseline away from `docs/migrations-archive/`; the baseline and archive are one atomic migration-history rewrite for SCRUM-1668.
- Do not edit an already-merged migration. Add a new forward migration with the next available numeric prefix.
- Treat migrations as prod-bound: a migration PR is not Done until prod Supabase schema/ledger evidence is captured.

## Recent migrations (PR #788)

- **0314_professional_education_foundations.sql**: Adds CPE/CLE metadata
  columns on `anchors`, service-role-only CPE/CLE provider registries with RLS
  + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, static seed entries, and secured-anchor
  immutability protection for the new metadata fields.

- **0307_fix_anchors_rls_statement_timeout.sql**: Consolidated three separate `anchors` SELECT RLS policies into one with scalar subquery wrappers for InitPlan evaluation. Same pattern applied to `attestations` (5 branches including `status='ACTIVE'`).
- **0308_seed_arkova_org_credits.sql**: Seeds `org_credits` for Arkova prod org with `EXISTS` guard for idempotency.

_Rollback rehearsed: 2026-05-16 on staging (ujtlwnoqfhtitcmsnrpq). Forward re-applied clean._
