## What This Folder Contains
Third-party integration connector cards for org admins and members to manage OAuth connections.

## Key Files
- `DocusignConnectorCard.tsx` — Org-level DocuSign OAuth connector: connect/disconnect, tokens never touch the browser (worker returns auth URL only). Queries `org_integrations`. SCRUM-2361 (DS-01): the *connect* action is gated on the shipped verified-org signal via `useCanIssueCredential` (SCRUM-1755) — denied orgs see `CONNECTIONS_LABELS.DOCUSIGN_NOT_VERIFIED` with a disabled Connect button (`data-testid="docusign-gate-denied"`); the worker `/oauth/start` is the authoritative gate, this is UX defense-in-depth. Disconnect is never gated.
- `MemberDocusignConnectorCard.tsx` — Member-level DocuSign OAuth connector (SCRUM-2044): same pattern as org-level but queries `member_integrations` and uses `/api/v1/integrations/docusign/member/*` endpoints. `data-testid="member-docusign-card"`.
- `DriveConnectorCard.tsx` — Google Drive OAuth connector: same pattern as DocuSign, tokens handled server-side only

## Dependencies
- `@/lib/workerClient` (workerFetch) — server-side OAuth URL generation
- `@/lib/supabase` — connection status reads

## Do / Don't Rules
- DO: Keep OAuth tokens server-side only — browser never sees or stores tokens
- DO: Use `workerFetch` for all OAuth URL generation
- DO: Gate the org connect button on `useCanIssueCredential` (the verified-org entitlement), but treat it as UX only — the worker is the real gate. Never gate disconnect.
